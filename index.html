  <h1> Escape the serial killer! </h1>
  <p>A serial killer has just escaped from jail and is holding you- a witness to her escapade, as a hostage. <br> She knocks
    you unconscious and by the time you awaken she is gone.<br> And you are alone, in a darkened room.<br>
    How will you escape?</p>

    <p>The first door you find has a lockpad on it, with a note hastily scribbled beside it. <br>
      You take it, and read 'what is the colour of my hair?'<br> Looking at the 'lockpad', you see that rather than having numbers on it, it has the whole alphabet.<br>
    What is the colour of your kidnapper's hair?</p>

    <p class="after" id="after">You put the letters into the lockpad- you hear a resounding click <br>
    as the locks open.<br> Slowly turning the handle, you find you
    can open the door now.</p>

    <p>You get to the third door and see light <br>emitting from underneath it..light!<br>
    Hope rises in you- finally, you can get out of here! But you see something in your periphral vision which makes you turn...
    and as you turn, you see two more doors.  Each emitting that same 'light'.
    Suddenly a booming voice sounds, from what appears to be a loudspeaker in the corner of the room. 
    YOU HAVE COME TOO FAR, the voice yells angrily, TOO FAR! I WOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW THAT I AM FOLLOWING 
    YOUR PATH RIGHT NOW, AND IF YOU CHOOSE THE WRONG DOOR I WILL MAKE SURE YOU NEVER HAVE THE CHANCE TO ESCAPE AGAIN-
    SINCE THE WRONG DOORS LOCK YOU IN.  1 IN 3 CHANCE KID!!
    The voice stops, and you realise this is your moment. Choose wrong, and you're gone, right and you can survive. <br>
    This is it.

    <p> A note is taped to one of the doors- a clue. It reads...<br>
      <em>Placed above, it makes greater things small.<br>
      Placed beside, it makes small things greater.<br>
      In matters that count, it always comes first.<br>
        Where others increase, it keeps all things the same.</em><br>
      What door do these statements fit?
